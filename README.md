# UGM UKARA 1.0 Challenge

## Task Definition
    
    Research in the area of automatic short-answer scoring is getting more and more attention 
    due to the need of making the assessment process faster. Despite the rapid progress on 
    automatic short-answer assessment, research in this area particularly for Bahasa Indonesia 
    has been very limited and only recently emerged as a topic.
    
    The main challenges on the development of automatic short-answer grading 
    for Bahasa Indonesia is the use of informal language in writing context. 
    The diversity of local language of the student is one of many factors that influence the writing 
    style and the vocabulary used by the students. In addition, students often include slang words
    which commonly used in daily conversation. 
    
    UKARA 1.0 Challenge aims to encourage more ideas and studies for developing automatic 
    short-answer scoring specifically for Bahasa Indonesia.
