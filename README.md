# UGM UKARA 1.0 Competition

UGM UKARA is a competition held by Universitas Gadjah Mada under NLP UGM.

#### Task Definition


    Research in the area of automatic short-answer scoring is getting more and more attention due to the need of making the assessment process faster. Despite the rapid progress on automatic short-answer assessment, research in this area particularly for Bahasa Indonesia has been very limited and only recently emerged as a topic. The main challenges on the development of automatic short-answer grading for Bahasa Indonesia is the use of informal language in writing context. The diversity of local language of the student is one of many factors that influence the writing style and the vocabulary used by the students. In addition, students often include slang words which commonly used in daily conversation. UKARA 1.0 Challenge aims to encourage more ideas and studies for developing automatic short-answer scoring specifically for Bahasa Indonesia.
